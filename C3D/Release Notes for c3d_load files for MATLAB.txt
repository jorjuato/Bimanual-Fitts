Release Notes for c3d_load files for MATLAB

V2.7 (Feb 21 2009)
Fixed LIMB_readC3D.m to be able to read files with > 127 events (255 max now), and in general, with > 127 elements per dimension in any parameter's data (255 max).

V2.6 (Jan 26 2008)
Fixed LIMB_readC3D.m to files with no analog channels, just parameters.  Changed precision of fread from int16 to uint16 on POINT.FRAMES param
% to allow trials with > 32767 frames (up to 65535 frames now).

V2.5 (Feb 26 2008)
Fixed LIMB_readC3D.m to be able to handle parametergroup descriptions longer than 128 characters (up to 255 is now allowed)

V2.4 (Jan. 3, 2008)
Field names are now forced to be valid using genvarname

V2.1 to 2.3 (Aug. 2007)
Characters that are disallowed in fieldnames (e.g. -, /, [, ) etc…) are replaced with underscore to create valid fieldnames.
Parametergroups that do not have a separate DESCRIPTIONS parameter now get one created based on the descriptions of the individual parameters.

V2.0 (July 2007)
Re-organized structure of function calls to be more intuitive and user-friendly.
