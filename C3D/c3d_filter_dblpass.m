%C3D_FILTER_DBLPASS Double-pass filter all analog data in c3d data_structure.
%	DATA_OUT = C3D_FILTER_DBLPASS(DATA_IN, METHOD, 'fc', FC) filters
%	all analog data in the structure DATA_IN. The data are all double-pass
%	filtered using a 3rd order filter for zero-lag filtering, with a 3db
%	cutoff of the 6th order final filter at FC Hz.  The sampling frequency
%	is extracted from DATA_IN.  The METHOD parameter can either be
%	'standard' or 'enhanced'.  The 'standard' method uses reflection of
%	data about the end-points to minimize starting and end transients
%	(similar to the filtfilt.m function in the Signal Processing toolbox).
%	The 'enhanced'  method builds upon the standard method to provide a
%	better reflection, particularly when a data stream starts or ends at
%	the peak of a noise spike.
%
%	Note: a typical values for FC for human kinematic data is 10 Hz.

%	coeffecients B and A.  The filter defined by B and A will be applied
%	twice (once forwards and once backwards) for double-pass filter that is
%	twice the order of the filter defined by B and A and with a 3dB cutoff
%	at the frequency at which there is 1.5 db attenuation for the filter
%	defined by B and A.
